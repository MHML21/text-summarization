      "</p>\n",
      "<p>The primary rule to remember when playing Euchre is that one is never required to play the trump suit (unless that is the one that is led), but one is required to follow suit if possible. (e.g., if diamonds are led, a player with diamonds is required to play a diamond.)  Failure to do this is called <i>reneging</i> (see <a href=\"/wiki/Euchre#Reneging\" title=\"Euchre\">below</a>).\n",

A player wishing the proposed suit to be named trump, orders up the card and the dealer adds that card to his or her hand. It is usually more advantageous to the dealer's team to select trump in this way, as the dealer necessarily gains one trump card. The dealer must then also discard a card face down to return his or her hand to a total of five cards. This discard is an important tactical decision, as the dealer, lacking any cards of a particular suit, can potentially create a \"void\" or \"short suit\" in their hand. That would allow him to play a trump card instead of being forced to follow that voided suit when it is led (see the later section on winning tricks, and \"two-suited\" in the Terminology section). If the player instead opts to pass, the option proceeds to the player to the left until either a player orders the card up or all players have passed.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBuzzy2010_12-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuzzy2010-12\">[12]</a></sup>\n",

Trump selection proceeds clockwise beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, where the player may name a suit different from that of the previous up-card as trump, or may pass. No card is ordered up in this round. If all players pass again, it is declared a misdeal. The deal passes to the player on the previous dealer's left, who reshuffles and deals a new hand.

      "<p>The team that selects trump is known as the \"makers\" for the remainder of the hand, and the opposing team is known as the \"defenders\". The makers must take at least three of the five tricks in the hand in order to avoid being euchred.\n",

      "<p>The player who played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump is played; then the highest trump card wins the trick.

      "<p>After all five rounds have been played, the hand is scored. The player to the left of the previous dealer then deals the next hand, and the deal moves clockwise around the table until one partnership scores 10 points and wins the game.\n",

The bidder signifies their desire to play alone by saying so after bidding. The bidder must make this call before play begins. During a <i>loner</i> or lone hand, the bidder's partner discards their cards, and does not participate in play of the hand. In some regional variants (see below), if the dealer's partner \"calls them up\"/\"orders it up\" (on the turned up card), they are obliged to go alone for that hand.\n",

The defenders can either check on the bid and bid nothing, thereby likely losing their ante; call the bid; or – if they feel confident that they can Euchre – raise the bid. Once a bet has been settled by a call on the bid, the hand plays out, with the winners of the bet adding that bet to their pot.

In some variants, reneging when a player or their opponent is going alone may result in a penalty of four points, equally applicable to the maker of trump and the opposing team, in order to equalize the potential values of a hand.

      "<p>Another variant of the \"farmer's hand\" rules states that if a player receiving all <b class=\"pokerhands\" style=\"\"><span class=\"playingcards\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cardranks\">9</span></span></b>s and <b class=\"pokerhands\" style=\"\"><span class=\"playingcards\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cardranks\">10</span></span></b>s  may call for a redeal. The dealer may not exercise this option (because the dealer picks up the card from the kitty).\n",

      "<p>In some variations, a player may not call trump with only a jack but must have another card of the same suit to do so. Sometimes this only applies to the dealer, and if a player is caught doing this, it is often treated as a renege.\n",

      "<p><b>Robson rules</b>: When a team wins all five tricks (normally or by going alone), they may choose to reduce the opposing team's score (by two or four, respectively) instead of adding to their own score. Additionally, if the dealer turns up a jack on the kitty, they may elect to go alone without seeing the rest of their hand. If all tricks are won via this \"blind loner\" hand, five points are awarded instead of the usual four; but a failure to win all tricks earns the defenders one point.
